Members of Lok Sabha (House of the People) or the lower house of India's Parliament are elected by being voted upon by all adult citizens of India, from a set of candidates who stand in their respective constituencies. Every adult citizen of India can vote only in their constituency.

We plan to create a blockchain system for each constituency where each eligible voter will act as a node in the blockchain (Constituency Level-Level 1). Further, we plan to create a new blockchain system where each constituency will act as a node for this second level blockchain system (State Level-Level 2). Taking all the states as nodes, we'll create a new third level of blockchain system. This way we will have a three level blockchain (National Level-Level 3).

This way, we can have a three level blockchain system, which will ensure security & transparency in the election system.
